Project: CV App
=============

A CV-building app that allows users to create, edit, and save CVs.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-react-cv-app.vercel.app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [React](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react) curriculum. It is the first project required for completion of the React Course [1/3].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Allow users to:
  - [x] add their general information like name, email, and phone number.
  - [x] add their educational experience (school name, title of study, and date of study).
  - [x] add their practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of jobs, date from and until when they worked for that company).
- [x] Include edit and submit button for each section or the whole CV.
- [x] Display the results in a mock-up CV.

What I Learned
-----

TOP's lessons were great to teach you how to build and deploy a React app. I learned how to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build React apps, and to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy them. They also taught me the fundamentals of React, but I struggled to understand them.

I had to browse [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn) to better understand components, JSX, props, state, conditional rendering, and keys. 

Notes
-----

At first, I didn't see much reason to use React. I thought it was overcomplicating things. I missed my good, ol' .getElementById() and .appendChild() friends.

But yeah, with a project like this, handling DOM manipulation by myself would be a problem. That's when I learned React's usefulness.

I finished the project but looking back, I could have handled things better. Not adding so much functionality into a single component, organizing my.css files into an 'assets' folder, handling props/data better so that the resume gets updated as the user types, etc.

Still, I'm proud of my messy code. Not too bad for my first React app.

Also, allowing users to print their resumes wasn't a requirement, but it felt dumb not to allow people to save/print their resumes. It will throw you an extra blank page, but it works. Troubleshooting this took longer than the project itself, and I still couldn't figure out why. I'll return later and fix this â€” trust me, bro.
