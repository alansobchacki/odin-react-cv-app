Project: CV App
=============

A CV building app that allows users to create, edit, and save CVs.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-react-cv-app.vercel.app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [React](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/react) curriculum. It is the first project required for completion of the React Course [1/3].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Allow users to:
  - [x] add their general information like name, email, and phone number.
  - [x] add their educational experience (school name, title of study, and date of study).
  - [x] add their practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of jobs, date from and until when they worked for that company).
- [x] Include edit and submit button for each section or the whole CV.
- [x] Display the results in a mock-up CV.

What I Learned
-----

At first, I didn't see much reason to use React. I thought it was overcomplicating things. I missed my good, old, .getElementById() and .appendChild() friends. Writing HTML inside Javascript? The madness!

But yeah, with a project like this, handling DOM manipulation by myself would be a problem. That's how I learned React's usefulness.

I had to browse [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn) to understand components, JSX, props, state, and keys. I finished the project but looking back, I could have handled things better. Not adding so much functionality into a single component, separating my.css files into a single 'assets' folder, handling props/data better so that the resume gets updated as the user types, etc.

Still, I'm proud of my messy code. I got it done, and hey, it's my first React project. 

Notes
-----

Allowing users to print their resumes wasn't a requirement, but it felt dumb not to allow people to save/print their resumes. It will throw you an extra blank page for whatever reason, but it works. 

Troubleshooting this took more time than the project itself, and I still couldn't fix it. I'll return at a later time and fix this (trust me bro).
